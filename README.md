    👋 Hi, I'm Vit Justinov "@vi-u" and 
    it is "another try to make IT right!"
    
    👀 I’m interested in cyber security and full-stack devops
    🌱 I’m currently teaching as I go
    
    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cyber security devops
    📫 Please reach me on vit.us@hotmail.com

        In an attempt to make IT applications more structured, 
        I have numbered the repositories with integers so that 
        the concept development logic is easy to read and understand, 
        and also debuggable.

The proposed logic is based on block development. 
A project consists of repositories or blocks. 
Where each block is a repository containing the code of the required IT concept.

        Another suggestion is that the entire build of the project 
        should be covered in decimal repositories, 
        say the first one will be placed from 10 to 19, 
        the second project will ocupy blocks from 20 to 29, etc.

For example, to use the Python app "Python Caesar Ciphering" 
in production of the Dockerized web app "Docker-Flask-Caesar-Cipher", 
we use the following structure:

10-Python-Caesar-Cipher

11-Flask-Template

12-Input-Flask-Form

13-Flask-Caesar-Cipher

14-Docker-Flask

15-Docker-Flask_Template

16-Docker-Flask-Caesar

17-Updating-Application

        Looking forward to your highly appreciated submissions!
